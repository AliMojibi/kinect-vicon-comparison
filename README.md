# Kinect-Vicon Comparison  
**Evaluating Kinect Sensor Accuracy for Kinematic Analysis Using the KERAAL Dataset (Course project for Medical Robotics)**

## üß© Overview  
This project investigates the **accuracy of the Microsoft Kinect sensor** in measuring human motion compared to the **Vicon motion capture system (gold standard)**.  
The analysis focuses on **rehabilitation movements for low back pain**, using data from the **open-source KERAAL dataset**.


## üéØ Objectives  
- Compare **Kinect** and **Vicon** motion capture data.  
- Compute kinematic measures in **position** and **velocity** domains.  
- Align Kinect and Vicon coordinate systems using the **Least-Squares Fitting of Two 3D Point Sets** algorithm.  
- Evaluate Kinect‚Äôs potential for **rehabilitation and clinical assessment**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods  
1. Data preprocessing and synchronization from the **KERAAL dataset**.  
2. Coordinate alignment between Kinect and Vicon data.  
3. Kinematic feature computation and error analysis.  
4. Evaluation of Kinect‚Äôs accuracy across different movement planes.

## üìä Results (Summary)  
- Kinect provided **reliable position and velocity estimates** for trunk rotation movements.  
- Accuracy varied depending on **movement type** and **plane of motion**.
